    "\n",
    "Ans:it is an empty list that contains no items.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99] like this.it puts 99 in the  end of list. \n",

    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]like this.it removes tge first cat in the cat.\n",

    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  list concatenation is +\n",
    "list replication is *\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:append() method put the value in last of the list.\n",
    "in insert() we put any value at any position according to  our need. \n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.list.remove(), del statement\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:both are goes through len().both have indexes & slices,can be use in for loops,can be concat or replicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:lists are mutable ,can be add values,change values & many more methods can be use & [] in this bracket list can be made.\n",
    "tuples is immutable.it cannot be done any fuction like list except index& count. () in this bracket tuples can be made\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:('42') by using trailing commas in this bracket()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:by using list[] & tuple() function respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:it contains reference to list values.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:copy.copy()will stores the copy of the object & their reference points.\n",
    "copy.deepcopy() stores the copy of the object as well  as recursively copies of the object.\n",
